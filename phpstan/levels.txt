0. basic checks, unknown classes, unknown functions, unknown methods called on $this,
    wrong number of arguments passed to those methods and functions, always undefined variables
1.possibly undefined variables,
    unknown magic methods and properties on classes with __call and __get
2. Unknown methods checked on all expressions (not just $this), validating PHPDocs
3.return types, types assigned to properties
4.basic dead code checking - always false instanceof and other type checks,
    dead else branches, unreachable code after return; etc.
5.checking types of arguments passed to methods and functions
6. report missing typehints
7.report partially wrong union types - if you call a method that only exists on some
    types in a union type, level 7 starts to report that; other possibly incorrect situations
8.report calling methods and accessing properties on nullable types
